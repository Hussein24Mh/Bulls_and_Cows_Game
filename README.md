# Rules Of The Game
On a sheet of paper, you will think of secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4.
The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed.

Then the program will tries to guess your string. 
For every guess the you gives the number of matches.

If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are "bulls",
if on different positions, they are "cows".

Thus a response is a pair of numbers â€” the number of "bulls" and the number of "cows". A try can contain equal digits.
